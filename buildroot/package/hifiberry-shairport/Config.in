          Enable support for libsoxr, the SoX Resampler library.

          Briefly, Shairport Sync keeps in step with the audio source
          by deleting or inserting frames of audio into the stream as
          needed. This "interpolation" is normally inaudible, but it
          can be heard in some circumstances. Libsoxr allows this
          interpolation to be done much more smoothly and subtly.
