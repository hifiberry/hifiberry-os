.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shairport-start
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shairport-start
is an event handler script that is automatically called by Shairport Sync when AirPlay playback begins on the device. This is 
.B not
a manual start/stop control script, but rather an event callback that responds to playback state changes.

Logs the start event with timestamp to /tmp/shairport-events.log
.IP \(bu 2
Writes "playing" status to /tmp/shairport-status
.IP \(bu 2
Optionally sends a desktop notification if notify-send is available
