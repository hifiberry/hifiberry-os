.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shairport-stop
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B shairport-stop
is an event handler script that is automatically called by Shairport Sync when AirPlay playback ends on the device. This is 
.B not
a manual start/stop control script, but rather an event callback that responds to playback state changes.

The script is a symbolic link to

which detects its invocation name and performs the appropriate action.

When playback stops, this script:
.IP \(bu 2
Logs the stop event with timestamp to /tmp/shairport-events.log
.IP \(bu 2
Writes "stopped" status to /tmp/shairport-status
.IP \(bu 2
Optionally sends a desktop notification if notify-send is available
